## 🌐 What I’m building

I don’t just make websites — I build **content ecosystems**:

- Blogs that scale into products  
- Notion → CMS → App pipelines  
- Personal brands that turn into platforms  
- Knowledge bases that become interfaces  

Everything starts as an idea.  
Then becomes **structure**.  
Then becomes **software**.

## 🧪 What I care about

- Neuro + behavior  
- UX that feels human  
- Systems that reduce friction  
- Interfaces that feel like **places**, not tools  
- Products that grow with the user  

I like things that:
- learn  
- adapt  
- and don’t break when people get weird
